-- Exercise 1: DVD Rental

-- Instructions

-- 1.You were hired to babysit your cousin and you want to find a few movies that he can watch with you.
-- 1.Find out how many films there are for each rating.

SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS film_count
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;


-- 2.Get a list of all the movies that have a rating of G or PG-13. 

SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG-13');


-- 1.Filter this list further: look for only movies that are under 2 hours long, and whose rental price (rental_rate) is under 3.00. Sort the list alphabetically

SELECT title, rating, length, rental_rate
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG-13')
  AND length < 120
  AND rental_rate < 3.00
ORDER BY title ASC;


-- 3.Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.


UPDATE customer
SET first_name = 'soukaina',
    last_name = 'el fajjaj',
	email = 'soukaina.elfajjaj@gmail.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;


-- 4.Now find the customerâ€™s address, and use UPDATE to change the address to your address (or make one up).


SELECT address 
FROM address;



UPDATE address  
SET address = 'lem' 
WHERE address_id = 1;
