-- Exercise 1 : Items and customers

-- Instructions

-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.
-- 1.Use SQL to get the following from the database:
-- 1.All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).

SELECT * 
FROM items
ORDER BY price;


-- 2.Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).

SELECT * 
FROM items
WHERE price >= 80
ORDER BY price DESC;


-- 3.The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) – exclude the primary key column from the results.

SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM custumers 
ORDER BY first_name 
LIMIT 3;


-- 4.All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)

SELECT last_name 
FROM custumers 
ORDER BY last_name DESC;
